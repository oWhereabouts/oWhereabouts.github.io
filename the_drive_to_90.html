      <h1>The Drive to 90, COVID-19 Vaccination Uptake in New Zealand</h1>
      <p>This map was made a leaving gift for a team member when I was on secondment at the Ministry of Health in the
        Vaccination Program during COVID-19. They had a background in spatial and had done incredible work in the team
        so wanted to create a map with impact that would be a reminder of what the work they did helped accompish which
        they would be proud to hang on their wall. This map has very little supporting information, such as annotations
        of the trends seen, as they had such a deep understanding of the data this seemed unnecessary.
